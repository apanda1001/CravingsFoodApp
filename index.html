        Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
        Hello there!
        Welcome to Cravings! This is a simple web application for foodies (like me!) 
        who get a craving to eat something new before every meal!
    </p>
    <h2 class = "heading-theme">
        What exactly does it do?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I have always struggled to figure out what I want for lunch or dinner, since my mind seems to be unable to think of more than a few combinations, and before every meal, I crave for something new. I am sure there are many more like me. This webpage will suggest combinations of common Indian dishes to all of them.
        <br>
        Basically, after you click that magic button you see below the text,
        some code helps the web application pick a combination of random dishes from three
        different arrays for dals, subzis and rotis and rice, each containing the list of common
        dals, subzis and rotis and rice respectively. The combo shall be displayed on the webpage, and 
        you can figure out what you want for lunch or dinner!
